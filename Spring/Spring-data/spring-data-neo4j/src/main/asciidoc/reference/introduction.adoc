In order to understand what Spring Data Neo4j can do it's important to understand
how an SDN application is structured and could have implications in how you design your application.

[[reference.architecture]]
== SDN Architecture

A high level look of the architecture looks like:

image::SDN-Architecture.png[Spring Data Neo4j Architecture,align="center",width="653",height="896"]

* ***Drivers*** are used to connect to the database. At the moment these come in 3 variants: Embedded, HTTP and the binary protocol Bolt.
* ***The Object Graph Mapper (OGM)***: This is similar to an ORM in that it maps database nodes to java objects. This library is agnostic of any framework (including Spring).
* ***Spring Data Neo4j 4***: Provides syntactic sugar and code on top of the OGM to help quickly build Spring Based Neo4j/OGM apps.

Those coming from other Spring Data projects or are familiar with ORM products like JPA or Hibernate may quickly recognise this architecture.
A bulk of the heavy lifting has been moved into the OGM.

[NOTE]
It's therefore worth noting that there *will be backward compatibility issues* when migrating to version 4.x, so be sure to check the <<migration,Migration Guide>> to avoid any unwanted surprises.

== How to use this reference


Spring Data Neo4j is largely broken up into two main components:

- <<reference.ogm-support, OGM Support>>: Provides close integration between Spring Data and the OGM; the main underlying technology used in SDN.
- <<neo4j.repositories, Spring Data Repository Support>>: Provides Spring Repository support.

It is recommended SDN developers also familiarise themselves with the OGM. The OGM reference documentation has been reproduced after this
section for convenience.
