== Spring Data R2DBC basics

This projects shows some sample usage of the work-in-progress R2DBC support for Spring Data.

=== Requirements

- A PostgreSQL database server running on port 5432, a database instance named `postgres` with a user `postgres` and an empty password.

=== Interesting bits to look at

- `InfrastructureConfiguration` - sets up a R2DBC `ConnectionFactory` based on the R2DBC Postgres driver (https://github.com/r2dbc/r2dbc-postgresql[r2dbc-postgresql]), a `DatabaseClient` and a `R2dbcRepositoryFactory` to eventually create a `CustomerRepository`.
- `CustomerRepository` - a standard Spring Data reactive CRUD repository exposing query methods using manually defined queries
- `CustomerRepositoryIntegrationTests` - to initialize the database with some setup SQL and the inserting and reading `Customer` instances.
