[[mongo.mongo-3]]
= MongoDB 3.0 Support

Spring Data MongoDB requires MongoDB Java driver generations 3 when connecting to a MongoDB 2.6/3.0 server running MMap.v1 or a MongoDB server 3.0 using MMap.v1 or the WiredTiger storage engine.

NOTE: See the driver- and database-specific documentation for major differences between those engines.

NOTE: Operations that are no longer valid when using a 3.x MongoDB Java driver have been deprecated within Spring Data and will be removed in a subsequent release.

== Using Spring Data MongoDB with MongoDB 3.0

The rest of this section describes how to use Spring Data MongoDB with MongoDB 3.0.

[[mongo.mongo-3.configuration]]
=== Configuration Options

Some of the configuration options have been changed or removed for the `mongo-java-driver`. The following options are ignored when using the generation 3 driver:

 * `autoConnectRetry`
 * `maxAutoConnectRetryTime`
 * `slaveOk`

Generally, you should use the `<mongo:mongo-client ... />` and `<mongo:client-options ... />` elements instead of `<mongo:mongo ... />` when doing XML based configuration, since those elements provide you with attributes that are only valid for the third generation Java driver. The follwoing example shows how to configure a Mongo client connection:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
	xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
	xmlns:mongo="http://www.springframework.org/schema/data/mongo"
	xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/data/mongo http://www.springframework.org/schema/data/mongo/spring-mongo.xsd
		http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">

  <mongo:mongo-client host="127.0.0.1" port="27017">
    <mongo:client-options write-concern="NORMAL" />
  </mongo:mongo-client>

</beans>
----

[[mongo.mongo-3.write-concern]]
=== `WriteConcern` and `WriteConcernChecking`

`WriteConcern.NONE`, which had been used as the default by Spring Data MongoDB, was removed in 3.0. Therefore, in a MongoDB 3 environment, the `WriteConcern` defaults to `WriteConcern.UNACKNOWLEGED`. If `WriteResultChecking.EXCEPTION` is enabled, the `WriteConcern` is altered to `WriteConcern.ACKNOWLEDGED` for write operations. Otherwise, errors during execution would not be thrown correctly, since they are not raised by the driver.

[[mongo.mongo-3.authentication]]
=== Authentication

MongoDB Server generation 3 changed the authentication model when connecting to the DB. Therefore, some of the configuration options available for authentication are no longer valid. You should use the `MongoClient`-specific options when setting credentials with `MongoCredential` to provide authentication data, as the following example shows:

[source,java]
----
@Configuration
public class ApplicationContextEventTestsAppConfig extends AbstractMongoConfiguration {

  @Override
  public String getDatabaseName() {
    return "database";
  }

  @Override
  @Bean
  public MongoClient mongoClient() {
    return new MongoClient(singletonList(new ServerAddress("127.0.0.1", 27017)),
      singletonList(MongoCredential.createCredential("name", "db", "pwd".toCharArray())));
  }
}
----

In order to use authentication with XML configuration, you can use the `credentials` attribute on `<mongo-client>`, as the following example shows:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
	xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
	xmlns:mongo="http://www.springframework.org/schema/data/mongo"
	xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/data/mongo http://www.springframework.org/schema/data/mongo/spring-mongo.xsd
		http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">

  <mongo:mongo-client credentials="user:password@database" />

</beans>
----

[[mongo.mongo-3.validation]]
=== Server-side Validation

MongoDB supports https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/schema-validation/[Schema Validation] as of version 3.2 with query operators
and as of version 3.6 JSON-schema based validation.

This chapter will point out the specialties for validation in MongoDB and how to apply JSON schema validation.

[[mongo.mongo-3.validation.json-schema]]
==== JSON Schema Validation

MongoDB 3.6 allows validation and querying of documents with JSON schema draft 4 (including core specification and validation specification) with some differences. `$jsonSchema` can be used in a document validator (when creating a collection), which enforces that inserted or updated documents are valid against the schema. It can also be used to query for documents with the `find` command or `$match` aggregation stage.

Spring Data MongoDB supports MongoDB's specific JSON schema implementation to define and use schemas. See <<mongo.jsonSchema,JSON Schema>> for further details.

[[mongo.mongo-3.validation.query-expression]]
==== Query Expression Validation

In addition to the <<mongo.mongo-3.validation.json-schema>>, MongoDB supports (as of version 3.2) validating documents against a given structure described by a query. The structure can be built from `Criteria` objects in the same way as they are used for defining queries. The following example shows how to create and use such a validator:

[source,java]
----
Criteria queryExpression = Criteria.where("lastname").ne(null).type(2)
    .and("age").ne(null).type(16).gt(0).lte(150);

Validator validator = Validator.criteria(queryExpression);

template.createCollection(Person.class, CollectionOptions.empty().validator(validator));
----

NOTE: The field names used within the query expression are mapped to the domain types property names, taking potential `@Field` annotations into account.

[[mongo.mongo-3.misc]]
=== Miscellaneous Details

This section covers briefly lists additional things to keep in mind when using the 3.0 driver:

* `IndexOperations.resetIndexCache()` is no longer supported.
* Any `MapReduceOptions.extraOption` is silently ignored.
* `WriteResult` no longer holds error information but, instead, throws an `Exception`.
* `MongoOperations.executeInSession(â€¦)` no longer calls `requestStart` and `requestDone`.
* Index name generation has become a driver-internal operation. Spring Data MongoDB still uses the 2.x schema to generate names.
* Some `Exception` messages differ between the generation 2 and 3 servers as well as between the MMap.v1 and WiredTiger storage engines.
